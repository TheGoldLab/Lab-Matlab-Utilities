function ps_ = logist_val(fits, data)% function ps_ = logist_val(fits, data)%% Uses the logistic model to compute p (probability of% making a particular decision) for the given data (m rows% of trials x n columns of data categories) and parameters% (nx1). Assumes logit(p) (that is, ln(p/(1-p)) is a linear% function of the data.% Assumes lower bound = 0; upper bound = 1;% mxn times nx1 gives mx1ps_ = 1./(1+exp(-(data*fits(:))));
